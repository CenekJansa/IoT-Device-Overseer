IoT Device ↔ IoT Platform:

    Uplink (Data): The Device sends raw sensor data (Telemetry Ingestion Context).

    Downlink (Control): The Platform sends commands or updates to the device (Command & Control Context).

Platform User → Web/Mobile Application ↔ IoT Platform:

    The user interacts with the application (e.g., a dashboard).

    The application calls the platform's APIs for Authentication (IAM), Device configuration (Device & Asset Management), Rule creation (Alerting & Rules), and Data retrieval (Data Analytics).

IoT Platform → External Systems:

    The platform sends alerts and notifications (Alerting & Rules Context) or exported data and reports (Data Analytics Context).
